# Calculator

## The Odin Project FOundations final project
A calculator with specific requierements for display and the handling of operations.

## Overview
- Goals for this project (Course goal for the students and personal goal towards the project).
- What was learned

### Goal
I think the main goal of this project from the perspective of the curriculum was to proof everything we've learned so far in the course by building a calculator that incorporates everthing i learned in the TOP foundations course from variables, datatypes, functions, DOM, booleans, etc.

This project helped me reinforce what i learned in the foundations course, using, things like variables to keep track of user input, functions to write and maintain reusable code, data types to handle operations, etc.

#### My personal goals.
My personal goals for this project included; **problem solving**, **debugging** and later into the project **Boolean Flags; how to know when you need them and how to use them properly**.
As for my personal goals, i'd say i fell short on most of them because of my approach towrads this project which.

Going forward i must:
1. Avoid getting overly exicted to do a project that i fail to read the instructions. 
2. Avoid procratinating so long until i lose the drive to do the project.
3. Always read the instructions and follow it to a tee before seeking YouTube and AI help.
4. Approach problems in such a way that will help me build my problem solving skills.

### What i learned during this project
- Reinforced my undrstanding on the basics of JavaScript
- The e object of a button and how to target it using  e.target.
- An empty variable is equivalent tp a false boolean.

Hoping to come back to this code to refactor it and make it better in the future
